# Quantized Particle Transformer

This repo contains a project that is working towards building a quantized and more efficient version of the Particle Transformer (ParT) machine learning model described in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03772) and its associated [repo](https://github.com/jet-universe/particle_transformer).
